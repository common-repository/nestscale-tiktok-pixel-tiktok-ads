### HOW NESTSCALE TIKTOK PIXEL INSTALLER HELP YOU?

NestScale: TikTok Pixels Installer plugin is the simple yet powerful solution for the unlimited installation of TikTok pixels on your WooCommerce store, along with powerful automatic event triggering. As a result, you will be able to deliver your most conversion-optimized TikTok ads that sell, based on accurate campaign performance data. 

#### Save time & resources with one-click TikTok Pixel installation

Even if you aren’t tech-savvy, you can easily create and install multiple TikTok pixels to your WooCommerce store in one click. No developer needed, no complicated setup errors. Keep updated with automatic TikTok pixel version release, no action required. 

#### Monitor performance and optimize your TikTok ads campaign 

Using our plugin, you can collect and send valuable data to TikTok by joining the power of both Pixels and Event API. While your installed TikTok pixel will collect information about the ad such as the IP address, the User Agent, and the time the pixel was fired, auto-event triggering provides a better understanding of who the visitors are and what happens after they interact with your ad. 

Each time your visitors complete an action, like clicking a button, visiting a new page URL, and so on, the event is fired and information will be sent to your TikTok Ad Manager. In this way, you can get more accurate ads manager reporting, truly understand ads performance and optimize them accordingly.

# Run high-converting ads with Automatic Events Triggering

With NestScale: TikTok Pixels Installer, you can create custom audiences based on the engagement data and where their visitors dropped off in the funnel for effective retargeting ad campaigns. For example, you can retarget those who have visited their website, viewed specific products but did not purchase, and so on. This will make your products memorable and enhance the possibility that a visitor will return to your store and eventually make a purchase. In addition, based on collected data from TikTok pixels, you can model lookalikes to find new customers and scale your ads faster.
